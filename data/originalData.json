Traditionally, Hercules is placed in the middle; on the left is a life of virtue (represented by a treacherous mountains) and a life of sin and unhealthy choices on the right (represented by lakes and wooded areas). IÂ¹ve maintained the positions of the different paths, but inverted the imagery because I think living an honest life can be easy and appealing. In the painting we see that Hercules is right in the process of making that choice: heÂ¹s looking towards the sweet side while his spear creates a visual barrier to the unhealthy side. I think the scene also relates perfectly to Coney Island Art Walls project; celebrating the possibilities of new development over the run-down norm. - Buff Monster"
